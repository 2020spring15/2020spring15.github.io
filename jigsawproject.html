    <h1>Fielding a Softball - Jigsaw Activity</h1>
    <section>
      <h5>*This activity is designed for people who are beginners or are interested in playing/understanding softball. <br></h5>
      <p>For this activity you will be in a group of five. Each student in a group will become an "expert" on one aspect of fielding. Once you have become an expert you will teach the rest of your group about your aspect of fielding.</p>

  <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Get into your assigned groups of five people.</li>
      <li>Each group member will be assigned a number from 1 to 3. This number corresponds with what aspect you will be teaching. </li>
      <li>The table below will show what aspect of fielding you are (your number) focusing on. Use the resource links to inform yourself about your topic.</li>
      <li>Once you have finished reading about your topic, group with those who have the same topic as you. Use this time as an oppurtunity to ask questions and clarify as well as brainstorm different ways to present your topic.</li>
      <li>Return to your original group; each student will present their aspect of fielding to the group.</li>
      <li>Once all groups are finished, the class will have a fielding quiz composed of the main points from each aspect of fielding.</li>
</ol>
