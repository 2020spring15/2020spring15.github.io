      <h4>Egypt to Scotland</h4>
    <p> The first government paid fire brigade was in Scotland (1824), led by James Braidwood. 	However, this was not the first brigade ever formed. One of the first brigades was in Ancient Rome but this brigade didn’t care about the citizens; they were only fighting fires for the money. Creemus, the leader of this brigade, would arrive on site with his men and if he didn’t like the offered pay he would let the building burn down.	
<br>
<br>
Before true brigades were formed, citizens would often gather together and pass buckets of water in a line to be dumped on a burning building. Long before this, Ancient Egyptians had actually developed a hose like device that spewed water but this concept was forgotten in the rise and fall of Empires; it would not resurface until the 1500s.</p>
