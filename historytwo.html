      <h4>The Role of Benjamin Franklin</h4>
    <p>In 1736, Benjamin Franklin began to put forward the idea of firefighting crews. Over the next twenty years, six firefighter companies formed in Philadelphia. This was both good and bad, for the fact that there were organized departments but these crews were fighting against one another. The reason these crews fought against one another was because of pay, who ever put out the fire first was paid.</p>
