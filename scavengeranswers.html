<ul>
<li>Question 1:
	Copyright is a protection measure for authors or creators of work deemed “original”, essentially the creator of the work is protected from anyone using the work as their own.</li>

<li>Question 2:
	Some things that can’t be protected by copyright are methods, titles, slogans, common symbols, fonts, list of ingredients (not recipes).</li>

<li>Question 3:
	Yes, one such rule is: that a copyright will only cover the content or features that can be protected by copyright. So what this means is that your whole website might not be protected but different features or content might be.</li>

<li>Question 4:
	The general idea behind Fair Use Laws is to allow some leniency in being able to use copyrighted work.</li>

<li>Question 5:
	70 years after the creator dies does the work become public access or “un-copyright”.</li>
</ul>
