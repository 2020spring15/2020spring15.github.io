	</div>
	<div class="content">
		<p><span>1</span> Following the ideals of the real life Golden Rule, treat others how you wish to be treated, this cyber rule reminds us to double check what we are about to send/post/pusblish. How would you feel if the roles were reversed?</p>
		<p><span>2</span> Essentially the same as "Remember The Human". However, this rule is more geared to following the laws and expectations (morals) of the internet.</p>
		<p><span>3</span> Different levels of formailty are required depending upon your activity in cyberspace. For example, an email to a professor/boss/collegue/peer/company is going to require higher formality than that of a text to a friend.</p>
		<p><span>4</span> Make your message easy to read and to the point, this is out of respect for the person who's recieving the message time. People are busy and often don't have time to read long paragphs that are not of important information.</p>
		<p><span>5</span> Use proper grammar and have knowldge of the topic you are discussing. This will make you appear more respectable as well as be more welcomed in cyberspace.</p>
		<p><span>6</span> The original purpose of the internet was to share information, as it it still used today. So, this rule is reinforce the sharing of expert or logical answers to questions.</p>
		<p><span>7</span> Help to make sure a difference in opinion or a "heated" arguement does not get to a point where it affects others as well as those involved, drastically.</p>
		<p><span>8</span> Do not share private information if it was only meant for you.</p>
		<p><span>9</span> In real life people often have more power over one another, the attempt in cyberspace is to not hold your technological knowledge over another person.</p>
		<p><span>10</span> If someone breaks a netiquette rule, be forgiving. If you feel that person needs to be told of their mistake, in a nice way, reach out to them privately rather than through a public forum.</p>
